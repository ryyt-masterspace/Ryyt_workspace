# The Regulatory Shift

For years, refunds were seen as a "Customer Service" issue. If you were late, the customer got angry. That was it.

But in 2025, the **RBI (Reserve Bank of India)** changed the game.

## The T+1 Mandate

The new Master Directions require that once a refund is triggered, the money must reverse to the source account within **T+1 days** (Transaction + 1 Day).

Failure to comply results in a penalty of **₹100 per day of delay**, payable directly to the customer.

### Why this matters
If you process 1,000 refunds a month and 10% are delayed by 5 days:
*   100 Refunds x 5 Days x ₹100 = **₹50,000 in Fines**.

Ryyt acts as your **Compliance Shield**, tracking these timelines automatically.
